# Getting Started

<br>

### Introduction

The Cube Restaurant is a personal hobby project of [Harsh P Patel](https://github.com/harshPPatel). This project is created to demonstrate my skills as a Front end developer and designer. I am planning to create several different projects build upon different web development technology. Currently I am using several different technologies to maintain this project.


### Story behind it

I was learning about different web techs during my summer 2019 like JS frameworks, Advance JS, PHP and node. I learned them but I wanted to improve my skills with more practical knowledge. I started building project and one day I got an idea to build one big project/website for some imaginary client who needs a website containing all the things i learned recently. And that's how I got this idea. Checkout Road map section for more info about upcoming projects.
