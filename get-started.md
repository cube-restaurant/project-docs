# Getting Started

## Introduction

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹!

Welcome to an open source project called 'The Cube Restaurant'. This project's aim is to learn how to create a production ready application with CQRS, Event Sourcing and Micro-services architecture. This is a dummy project so we will not have thousands of users using this site but we will design it in a way so that we can scale our website depending on the users load.

What inspired me to start this project is that it is really hard to find sources which can help you to implement tech for production app. You can easily find tons of tutorials on how to make side projects with no real amount of user base but in the real world, the situation is completely different.

The project will include several different sub-projects like different web apps, main website for restaurant, mobile apps and we might also create desktop app for admin. I will be streaming this project on Twitch and later I will be uploading those streams to YouTube so that you guys can find it for reference.
