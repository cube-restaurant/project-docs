# How To Contribute

This page shows **basic** Guidelines of contribution process in this project. Each projects has their own coding guidelines. Please follow those guidelines for individual project.

<br>

::: tip For Project Contributors
As a project contributors, you should work on the repository directly. You can skip the first two steps.

## Step 1 : Fork the Repository
On GitHub, go to the repository to your GitHub account or to your organization. This will create the current copy of the project to your account. If you will make any changes to this repository, it will not affect the main code. So you can play it with however you want.

## Step 2 : Clone forked Repository
After forking the repository to your account, it is time to get this code locally. Use git clone command to clone it locally. You can also use any GUI app to clone it.

## Step 3 : Create Branch
Create a new branch to start working on the repository. Checkout [GitHub Coding Guidelines](/coding-guidelines/github.html) page to for naming your branches. If you want to start working from specific branch, checkout to that branch, and then create new branch from that branch.

## Step 4 : Start project locally in development
Checkout package.json file for all commands related to the project. Checkout Read Me of the project to know about package commands in details. Run the dev command to start the repository locally.

## Step 5 : Commit Changes
Now it's your time! Add your code, make any changes you want. Add your new feature or fix the issue. After specific milestone, make commit to the branch. You can make multiple commits too!

## Step 6 : Check for Latest updates on parent/master branch
Once you are done with the code you are working, it is time to check if there is any changes in master or the parent branch while you were working on the project. Checkout to those branches and pull the changes locally and merge them to your working branch.

## Step 7 : Make Pull Request
Once you complete writing the code, create a pull request to the main repository. Please never make pull request to **master** branch (unless it is a hotfix for the project). Prefer **development** branch or **parent** branch to make pull request.

## Step 8 : Wait for Review and Reply
Once making pull request, now wait until admin review your code. At this step, admin will test your code and if everything is good, he will merge the request. If some error is found in your code, admin will explain the problem before closing your pull request. Read the explanation, solve the errors/problems and than make a commit with those changes. Inform your updated changes to the Project Owner or other Project Contributors for code review.
