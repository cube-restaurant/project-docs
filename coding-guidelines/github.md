# Coding Guidelines - GitHub

<br>

While working on projects, we have created few guidelines for naming branches on repo. Please follow these guidelines to create branch names.

## Features

If you are coding some feature on the project, prepend the feature name with `feature/`.

**For Example:**

If you are working on the Grid System for framework, create feature branch as follow.

```shell
feature/grid-system
```

## Fix

Fixes are usually created on development branch. These fixes are with low priorities.

**For Example:**

If you are working on the Grid System's breakpoint for framework, create fix branch as follow.

```shell
fix/grid-system-breakpoints
```

## Hot Fix

Hot Fixes are those changes which are required with high priority on production branch.

**For Example:**

If you are working on the Grid System's columns for framework, create hotfix branch as follow.

```shell
hotfix/grid-system-columns
```

## Contribution Branch

If you are contributing to any branches from above, postpend your name to the branch's name.

**For Example:**

If you are contributing to the Grid System's columns for framework, create branch as follow.

```shell
feature/grid-system-columns-harshPPatel
```
